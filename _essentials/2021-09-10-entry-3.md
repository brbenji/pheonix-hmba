### how do you get people on an email list?
**answer:** you have to ask them to join

In the last entry, the practical section says to create an email signup landing page using MailChimp‘s tools. The best would be to create a signup page on your own website but MailChimp works for now. With one of those setup the next step is to invite people to join. But who?

### you‘ve got contacts
You‘ve got a phone and email account that‘s chock-o-block full of folks. Most of them at least kinda know you. In those contacts are a number of people who‘d love to stay in the loop on your music.

## the clean way to do this
The basic concept is to send people an invitation to join with a link to take them to the sign-up landing page.

### mail-merge
You need to send a lot of people the same email. While putting everyone into a BCC line of an email might work, I didn't do that. I went a slightly fancier route and used a classic thing called **mail-merge**. 

Luckily Google has made mail-merge simple. With a Gmail account, a draft email, and a Google Sheets spreadsheet; you can send a single email to a lot of people. You can even make it custom (i.e. add their names). [Learn how.][r&r]

## learn from my mistakes
At first I sent out an epic of an email, explaining everything and why. Complete with images and a dozen links. Not surprisingly nobody signed-up for my email list. [See the first email][r&r].

### three-lines and one-link
Later with the advice of [my oldest cousin][r&r]. I created an email loosely following the guide: “three-lines and one-link”. This minimal approach gives the catchy headline of what you're doing with an invitation to sign-up for your email list.

### my much more succesful email
>Subject: Hey First name. -Ben Brown
>
>Hello First name,
>
>You're super busy and probably haven't heard anything about my little underground project, but for the past two years I've lovingly poured work into helping broke musician friends “make it” online. If you'd like to learn more about what we're doing together–may I invite you to enter your email on this page [howmbase.com/ben][howm-ben]. *I hate sending emails so don't expect a lot of them.*
>
>Cheers,
>
>Ben Brown

I sent this email to around 50 people—family, friends, co-workers and alumni.

## the practicals
Craft a three-line and one-link email inviting people to your sign-up landing page. Open up your contacts and go down the list identifying anyone who might like to know what you‘re up to. Move those folks into a new group “possible mailees”. Be brave. Take a few risks. Send your email invitation to everyone using mail-merge.

**Next** entry we'll go over how to send this invitation over text so you can invite the “possible mailees” you only have a phone number for.
