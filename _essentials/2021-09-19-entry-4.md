## missing emails
You probably have a longer list of phone numbers than emails in your phone. Let's talk about how to invite them to your email list.

### same concept
Once again the idea is to simply send an invitation with a link to your sign-up landing page.

### mass text
How do you send a lot of people the same text message without ruining their day? Cause we all know, getting put in a group text is a modern curse. 

The answer is the **mass text**. 

Technically this is switching *group messaging* from MMS to SMS. Without getting in the weeds. SMS is your simple words only texting. MMS is your data using messaging that allows you to send pictures and group people into a group message. 

### different for different phones
#### android phone
The phone type I've always had. This one I can give concrete instructions for:
- In the the texting app click on the three-dot-menu in the upper right corner
- Go to Settings.
- Go to Advanced. *yes we're getting nerdy*
- At the top is **Group messaging**. After clicking on that, select "Send an SMS reply to all recipients and get individual replies (mass text)".

With that small change you can create a group text and when you send them the one text message you'll have created a new text thread between each person and yourself only.

#### iphone
Beats me. [Instructions from online][r&r]

#### samsung is different
I don't have a samsung but I know they have weird ways of building group texts and making the setting **mass text**. [The best instructions I can find.][r&r]

### my text invitation
>Good day! Sorry to interrupt, but there's a little underground project I work on to help my musician friends “make it” online. You'd be awesome to enter your email at [howmbase.com/ben][howm-ben] to learn about what's happening—Ben Brown

I texted this to over 100 people—family, friends, co-workers, and alumni.

## practicals
Shorten your email message from the previous **practicals** to look like a casual text message. Turn your group messaging to **mass text** mode. Add everyone into a group. Send the text. Respond to everyone who texts you back.
