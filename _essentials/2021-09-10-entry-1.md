## three things
For people to *get you* and get a hold of you; you need at least 3 things online:
1. a sound
2. an image
3. contact info

#### a sound
People gotta know what you sound like. The sound can totally be a demo. Put your best stuff out there. 

#### an image
People gotta know what you look like. The best is to have instruments or something in the image that makes clear you are a musician.

#### contact info
People gotta be able to find you and contact you. Ideally, you have your own website. But a social media page that displays a **myband@gmail.com** email where people can contact you works great.


## the practicals
Record and mix a demo. Take a nice photo with your instrument. Then create a YouTube video with that photo as the background and your demo music playing underneath it. Post that on your preferred social media spot with the contact email proudly displayed.

Now you are ready to send bookers to this page. They can decide whether your sound and look are what they are into. 

*It is the bare minimum. It is the first step. Welcome.*
