Because your music takes the center stage here I'd recommend you share some part of your process. 

## process
Your process for making music has to be done, so you might as well find a place in there where you can document it and share with your **Patrons**. 

### do people want this?
This gives a sense of momentum, exclusivity and can be genuinely interesting.

### examples
A *Secret Demo Club* like [Orla Garland][r&r] is a popular choice. Share phone recordings for flegling songs or photos of early lyric creations. 

Live streams from the studio is something I expect to become a standard offering. 

Learn to capture, package and share one of the elements from your process. Don't let it take up too much time. **Patrons** really want you to be making music.
