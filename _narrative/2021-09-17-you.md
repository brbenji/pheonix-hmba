## you

### who are you?
You're a musicians. More truly your a musician + anything else you care deeply about.

### where did you come from?
An overwhelming love for music, bringing joy and meaning.

### where are you now?
In a transforming business and in a world in need of meaning.

### where are you going?
To directly deliver the joy and meaning you receive from music to others.

## why do what you do?
Your **why** is to step out of the way and let others have the same spark of joy and meaning you found in music when it first captured you.

## your Story

### beginings
Remeber your first moments falling in love with music. The warm fuzzies you couldn't resist. Your life redirected to a brand new path from that moment.

### the desire
Feeling overwhelmed by music you wanted to make, to experience it, to understand it, **to share**.

### but
But money. Life and its practical needs took precednts, over sharing this spark. And worse, the music business has transformed. Now the path is much less clear and a fear of music being pointless creeps in. Feels like putting music aside is the most realistic and responsible thing to do.

### resolution
Wait a minute though. Return to your first moments with music. The joy. The meaning. A purpose flows from that. And I'm here to tell you the transformation of the music business is a good thing, especialluy for you. New paths opened up for musicians to share their spark with and be supported by others all over the world. Unlike everbefore you can directly connect with **Patrons** who care about your music and you. A beautifully reciprocal partnership awaits with the fruit of joy and meaning.
