### who are these people?
Ultimately patrons are partners. They receive joy from what you do. They desire the best for you and from you. 

The ideal patron will be patient and give you room to create. They will enable you to [develop as an artist][r&r], by providing financial support and valuable feedback.

#### you probably already know them
Until you reach the point where your music is in front of complete stranges, patrons will most likely be your family, friends, co-workers and alumni. 

### what do they want from you?
- **Availability**—Patrons want to hear from you. I'm sure many of your family and old friends feel like they don't hear from you enough.
- **Participation**—Patrons want to be in an exclusive group, to be apart of what you're doing. 
- **Growth**—Patrons want to see you grow. 

## service
The best frame to view your relationship to your patrons is one of service to them. 

**Answer this question:** *How can you bring your patrons joy?*

### bringing joy
In a true sense, if you make something that brings **you** joy there is a slice of the world that will find joy in it too. And since the world is so large, that tiny slice can be a viable group for supporting you. This concept is fleshed out in the now famous internet article [1,000 True Fans][r&r]. 

Bringing joy to yourself can be a guiding star when considering what to make or say, but remember: you're in service to others.

### remember your value
As we went over in the last entry, musicians bring to the table deeply valuable ways of being our culture can benefit from: meaning, flow, spirituality, and philosophy. While noone will request these things from you, using your creativity to deliver these intangibles to your patrons will be one of the most fufilling things you can do as a musician. Makes me think of [Alicia Keys][r&r].

### bringing meaning
When you think about meaning in life, you have to remember that meaning is a metaphor. It goes like this: “a sentence has meaning. I want my life to have meaning too”. This comes from [John Verveake][r&r]. 

In final chapters of [Flow][r&r] the meaning of life is “making meaning”, which is to say you've got to actively put meaning into your life. 

For your patrons, you can't actually give them meaning. But you can express your meaning that comes from music to inspire them to create their own.

## wrapping up
When you open yourself up to receiving support from patrons, you're opening yourself up to a partnership and relationship. While this relationship is not about doing yet even more things; like all relationship, it does take real energy to maintain. 

- Be available by setting a schedule for posting things online. And respond to DMs.
- Allow patrons to participate by asking them questions and getting feedback from them.
- Grow by always trying new things and expanding who you reach.

I hope you feel worthy to begin gathering patrons around you. I hope you can now see what this partnership can look like. I hope you accept the challenge of delivering joy and meaning to others and to allow them to give back to you.
