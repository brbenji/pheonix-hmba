### conviction
Before I tell you to go find your tribe of **Patrons**, I first need to distill in you a conviction of your own value to others. 

While your music is involved, your value comes first from **who you are**. A musician has within themselves many ways of being our culture is desperately missing. And you can bring them back.

## big thoughts
Please allow me to speak on things beyond me to make my point about your value. I'll attempt to keep this from getting too heavy, but let's start big: 

#### meaning
Our culture has a plague of meaninglessness. I felt this growing up. A looming sense of pointlessness.

Despite all odds, musicians often find a sense of meaning in music. They pursue music against most rational analysis. Music-making is compulsory, and there is a kind of transcendent meaning drawn from that.

#### flow
The happiest state achievable is flow. Many look for happiness in many other ways, but flow is the best for actually granting it. The more flow in the world, the better.

Musicians, through practice and creation, are familiar with the state of flow. The act of teaching others your craft is teaching someone how to enter flow. Even creating music that engages the listener can grant the state of flow.

#### sprituality
Our culture has closed the door to any notion of spirituality. Closing this door has unwittingly severed vital parts of the human experience away from most people. However, there is a window open. Music has oddly maintained some amount of mystery and spiritual connection.

Music is the last place to reclaim a necessary part of human life. Musicians have a unique position to guide people back to spirituality and to become more whole. 

#### philosophy
Art is how the latest understandings of philosophy are distributed into a culture. Many ideas can't be directly taught to a general audience. But art allows people to interact with an idea, to experience it.

When a musician wrestles with a new philosophy, it comes out in their creations. Once created, others can participate in and be changed by the concept.

## real value and worthy work
Our culture neglected many vital aspects of life. However, musicians are uniquely qualified to bring that life back into our culture. *[Alicia Keys][r&r] is a fine example.* 

Being a musician is not easy. It takes countless hours, and everything costs money. Not anyone can do this. *If you're willing to do this work*, you deserve to be supported as you take it on.

This brings us back to **Patrons**â€”your partners. Let's talk about them next.

### resources and references
- [Alicia Keys' Tiny Desk Concert][Alicia] shows off her skills at delivering these ways of being. She is such a cultural force. 
- [Awakening from the Meaning Crisis][meancris] with John Verveake goes much deeper into meaning.
- [Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience][flow] by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi originated the ideas on flow. 
- I'm not an advocate for Bret Weinstein, but I love this roundtable discussion mid-2020 and the quote Bret gives at the very end about art.
