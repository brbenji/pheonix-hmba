# these way of making musician profiles feels tedious but easy to integrate with this theme.
# a better option would involve combining icons into one files, each musicians can have the full list of icons, but use a bullean to confirm which ones appear.
# right now that is achieved by copy and pasting in this file, then changing labels, and urls. not that bad.
