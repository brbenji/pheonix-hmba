# **howm**cast nft
{: .text-center}
  I have to be careful about how I phrase all of this. First off, owning an NFT is not owning the copyright. NFT ownership ≠ copyright. All rights are reserved. This NFT doesn't mean you own stock in **howm**, but you are allowed to transfer it as you wish, including selling the NFT.
  
  Your wallet address or name will be proudly displayed next to your **howm**cast episode wherever possible.
  
  The original **howm**cast sponsors will be thanked by name in the description of the podcast episode. But any names of new owners of the NFT from sales or trades will be automatically displayed where possible.
  
Here's an official NFT Terms statement that I believe will cover what I need. *Thank you [Mike Shinoda](https://www.mikeshinoda.com/NFTTerms) for writing these terms up.*  

### nft terms
