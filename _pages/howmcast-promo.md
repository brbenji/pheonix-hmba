# material for promoting your howmcast!
Hello musicians! Here we have your **sharing link, teaser, extra and current release date**. 

- The **release date** can change if you have a better time. *For example, you may want to release the episode the day after you launch your Patreon.*

- The **extra** is the casual conversation we had after the interview. We suggest you put it behind some pay-wall, like Patreon, and entice people to join with the promise of this extra content.

- The **teaser** is for you to post on social media or to an email newsletter, before the release date. So you can drum up a little bit of buzz, like a small Hollywood release. 

- The **sharing link** should be straight forward. The link won't work until the day the podcast is published. 

For more details on how to best promote your episode of **howm**cast I wrote [a post for you here.][hp]

### quick instructions
- Copy your howmcast episode's bit.ly sharing link and spread it around.
- Dowload your teaser and extra. Easiest ways is to right-click the link and select “Save Link As...”. *Otherwise your browser should open a window with an audio player. It'll have a three dot menu you can click and select to download.*
