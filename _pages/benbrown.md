Hello! I'm Ben Brown. A sound engineer aiding nearly professional musicians in building a viable career using the internet. 

In a nut shell, I recommend choosing a charity to champion, making a [Patreon][p], signing up for [ConvertKit][c] and making at least one really great piece of merch.

If you'd like personal consultations, send me an email. We can set a time to meet. 

Go to [howmbase.com/ben][hbb] to learn more about what I'm doing, sign-up for my email-list, join my Patreon and listen to our podcast.

Cheers!
