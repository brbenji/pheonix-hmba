# patreon sponsor tier faq

## how do I receive my nft?
  - First, you'll need to create a Tezos wallet. I highly recommend [Kukai](https://wallet.kukai.app/).
  - Second, once you know your wallet address, message it to me through Patreon. Your Tezos wallet address will look like this (tz1XMtswbbJzjnnyBn6cYcXU5Z3kQemLpvH8).
    - Caution: Make sure you're capable of logging out and back into your new crypto wallet. I've made the mistake of loosing my wallet keys before. So double check before I send the NFT to an address you can't access.
  - Third, I'll transfer the NFT over to your address for free. It'll cost me less than a penny on Tezos. 


## how do I get a custom tezos name for my wallet? 
  - You might want to have your name or business displayed as the owner of the NFT and not just a set of random characters. 
  - Go to [Tezos Domains](https://tezos.domains/) and connect your wallet.
  - Search for any name you want to be displayed as one of the limited owners of your **howm**cast episode NFT.
    - *Please be kind. This will be very public.*
  - You'll need a little over 1 Tezos to claim your Tezos Domain name. 
  - You can buy Tezos on Coinbase and withdrawal it to your new Tezos wallet. 
  - Or, you can message me with the name you'd like. I can buy you a year of it and transfer ownership to you.


## how many nft will be made per episode? and who gets them?
  - For each episode of the podcast, the total number of NFT editions will be around 25. About 15 will be available for sponsors. 
  - An NFT will be given to everyone who makes the podcast possible. 
    - 1 for ben
    - 1 for megs
    - 1 for jett (our word of mouth guy)
    - 1 for the podcast editor (might be ben)
  - And 4 go to the musician. 
    - 1 to keep. 3 to do whatever they'd like with.
  - And 1 extra NFT that will be held by **howm** as a group. And will be sold off in some date in the future.
    - The proceeds will be used to help **howm** musicians start their own crypto projects.

## where is my name displayed?
  - The original **howm**cast sponsors will be thanked by name in the description of the podcast episode. But any names of new owners of the NFT from sales or trades will bautomatically displayed where possible.
  - Right now, you can see your name next to your NFT on objkt.com.
  - In the near future I hope to proudly display your names on my website howm.art, squarespace would make me pay extra to do it. 
  - And in the far future I hope all podcast apps will display your names next to your episodes.


## why is this monthly? I only want the one nft.
  The Sponsor Tier is for people who want to support my efforts to help musicians with **howm**. Your giving is mostly general support, the NFT is a thank you gift to you.
  Besides Patreon either works as monthly or “pay per thing”. I can't make it do a mix of both. If we got more sophisticated in the future.


## what if I cancel my monthly pledge before you release another podcast?
  - You are guaranteed at least 1 **howm**cast NFT per month you are a Sponsor Tier Patron. 


## can I pick my favorite episode from the past?
  Message me on Patreon I'll see what I can do.


## how do I learn about upcoming **howm**cast episodes I might want to sponsor?
  - Sign up for the [**howm**run](https://howmbase.com/ben).
  - We email you the things happening with **howm**. This will include new musicians who join us, new releases from current musicians, upcoming **howm**cast episodes, and when musicians have set up Patreons or chosen their Charities.
  - I expect this to be released every other month. We'll collect the note worthy changes over 8 weeks and email you the **howm**runs.


## how much are the royalties?
  - 7.5% royalties will go to an account owned by **howm**. 
  - Objkt.com, the NFT marketplace we use, takes a 2.5% cut of every sale. I decided to make that I nice round 10%, by making our royalties 7.5%. This way you can quickly understand that you'll receive 90% of any NFT sale you make


## who gets the royalties?
  - The royalties will be sent to a separate address for **howm**. Currently howm.brbenji.tez.
  - Royalties will be used to help musicians begin their own NFT projects. 
  - While the funds sit and wait, I'll invest it as best I can.

## can I get more than 1 NFT per episode?
  - Yes, if you double your pledge from $40/mo to $80/mo you will receive a second NFT. You can also receive a third for $120/mo. But for now that will be it. This doesn't remove any of the sponsor slots, it adds to the total number of NFT editions.

## why tezos? why not ethereum?
  - I made a video explaining [why I love Tezos](https://youtu.be/BKFSy6nA4hI).
  - When you create an NFT you have to make a choice about which Blockchain you'll create on. The standard Blockchain is Ethereum, but a great alternative is [the Tezos blockchain](https://www.gemini.com/prices/tezos).
  - But for here it will suffice to say Tezos is cheap. And Ethereum is expensive. I didn't want to put you guys through that. You shouldn't have to pay $20 to give your extra NFT to a friend.

## are there legal terms for use of the nft?
  Yes, [NFT Terms.](/nftterms/)
