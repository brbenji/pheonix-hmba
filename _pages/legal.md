### amazon associate disclosure
Hello! Ben here. I need to tell you I'm in the Amazon Associates Program. As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. Any of the links going out to Amazon benefit me if you purchase *anything* from that new window. Mostly I've linked to books, but if you shop at all I'll be financially rewarded by Amazon. 

I'm disclosing this because I legally have to, but also for musicians to understand that this is yet another stream of income they could be setting up. [Sign-up for the Amazon Affiliate Program here.][aap]
