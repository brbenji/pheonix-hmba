# entry 1: Three Requirements
## Three Things
For people to “get you” you need:
- a sound
- an image
- a place

### a sound
People gotta know what you sound like. Can totally be a demo. Put your best stuff out there. 

### an image
People gotta know what you look like. The best is to have instruments or something in the image that makes it clear you‘re musicians.

### a place
People gotta be able to find you and contact you. Ideally you have your own website, but a social media page that displays a **myband@gmail.com** email where people can contact you is great.


## the practicals
Record and mix a demo. Take a nice photo with your instrument. Create a video with that photo as the background and your demo playing underneath it. Post that on your preferred social media spot with the contact email easily found.

Now you’re ready to send bookers to this page where they can decide whether your sound and look is what they’re into. 

It’s the bare minimum. It’s the first step.

# entry 2: Only Two Things are Real
the internet has an ephemeral quality. things come and go. 

Only 2 things have any reality online:
- your own website
- emails

The warning is: **don't rely on any platform for your online career.** Any platforms can dissovle overnight and no amount of likes or subscribes will be able to follow from there. 

### old stuff works
Because email and websites have been around forever there is reason to believe they‘ll be with us for a long time. 

### case for emails
Emails are kinda odd. they are an ancient part of the internet, but still heavily used today. People will change physical addresses more often than their email address. When someone gives you their email, you‘ve got direct access to them. Noone is in between you and them. 

### case for a website
When you pay for a website and manage it yourself, you‘ve got your place. You control what‘s on it whether it‘s online or not. A platform can tweak their censorship algorithm and accidentally silence you.

# the practicals
Begin collecting emails. Create a free MailChimp account. In MailChimp you can create a standalone web page that collects emails called a **landing page**. Text and email the people down your contact list, inviting them to join your mailing—more about this in **entry 3**.

If you‘re brave enough to venture into making a website, SquareSpace is an elegant option. About $165/yr. but if that scares you, just stick with the email collection for now.

# entry 3: Zero to One an Email list
“but wait!? if I need permission to add emails, how do I start the email list?”

## how do you get people on an email list?
**answer:** you have to ask them to join

In the last entry, the practical section says to create an email signup landing page using MailChimp‘s tools. The best would be to create a signup page on your own website but MailChimp works for now. With one of those setup the next step is to invite people to join. But who?

### you‘ve got contacts
You‘ve got a phone and email account that‘s chock-o-block full of folks. Most of them at least kinda know you. In those contacts are a number of people who‘d love to stay in the loop on your music.

### sort out the potential mailees
Open up your contacts and go down the list identifying anyone who might like to know what you‘re up to. Move those folks into a new groups “possible mailees email” and “possible mailees text”. Be brave. Take a few risks.

Make one list for emails and one for text. You‘ll find that you don‘t have both of these for everyone.


## the clean way to do this
The basic concept is to send people an invitation to join with a link to take them to the signup landing page.

### mass email
You need to send a lot of people the same email. while putting everyone into a BCC line in an email might work, I didn't do that. I went a slightly fancier route and used a classic thing called **mail-merge**. 

Luckily Google has made this simple. with a Gmail account, a draft email, and a Google Sheets spreadsheet you can send a single email to a lot of people, even making it custom (i.e. add their names). [Learn how.][r&r]
