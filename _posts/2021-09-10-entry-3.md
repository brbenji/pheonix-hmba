“but wait!? if I need permission to add emails, how do I start the email list?”

# how do you get people on an email list?
**answer:** you have to ask them to join

in the last entry, the practical section says to create an email signup landing page using MailChimp‘s tools. with that setup the next step is to invite people to join. but who?

# you‘ve got contacts
you‘ve got a phone and email account that‘s chock-o-block full of folks. most of them at least kinda know you. don‘t go blasting everybody but in those contacts are a number of people who‘d love to stay in the loop on your music.

# the clean way to do this
open up your contacts and go down the list identifying anyone who might like to know what you‘re up to. move those folks into a new group “possible mailees”. be brave. take a few risks. 


- your own website
- emails

the warning is: **don't rely on any platform for your online career.** any platforms can dissovle overnight and no amount of likes or subscribes will be able to follow from there. 

# old stuff works
because email and websites have been around forever there is reason to believe they‘ll be with us for a long time. 

# case for emails
emails are kinda odd. they are an ancient part of the internet, but still heavily used today. people will change physical addresses more often than their email address. when someone gives you their email, you‘ve got direct access to them. noone is in between you and them. 

# case for a website
when you pay for a website and manage it yourself, you‘ve got your place. you control what‘s on it whether it‘s online or not. a platform can tweak their censorship algorithm and accidentally silence you.

## the practicals
begin collecting emails. create a free MailChimp account. in MailChimp you can create a standalone web page that collects emails called a **landing page**. 

if you‘re brave enough to venture into making a website, SquareSpace is an elegant option. about $165/yr. but if that scares you, just stick with the email collection for now.
