# a secret
Here's a little secret about the podcast. The podcast doesn't have to be a big popular thing to be successful. What follows is how to make your **howm**cast episode a success! 

By success, I mean, directing folks toward someway to support your music, like Patreon.

## your episode

With your episode you have a solid piece of long-form content. Who wants long-form content from you? People who already know and like you. 

Family, friends, co-workers, and alumni all come to mind. 

**How do you send them your episode so they can listen?** 
You'll have a bit.ly link of your podcast episode. Usually the format is bit.ly/howmcast-{your first name} 
>ex: bit.ly/howmcast-levi

This link sends potential listeners to your podcast episode on **howm**base.com. *On that page there are links out to the major podcast services and it lays out the links and description in a nice way.*

## where to put this link?

### post on social media

This is obvious and the least you can do.

### email and text is superior

The better option, the option that will get much higher rates of people checking it out is sending your bit.ly link directly. Just like a person. 

Email or text your podcast link to at least 15 to 20 people. *Put a few people in there that make you nervous. Be brave.*

>“Hey! I didn't want you to feel left out. Hang out with musicians interviewed me on their podcast. We had a great time. You'll enjoy it. <u>bit.ly/howmcast-name</u>”

## making patrons

Because you'll be sending this long-form content to the people who want to hear it, these people are only one step away from becoming patrons. The whole point of the **howm**cast and **howm**base is to eventually bring folks to your Patreon. 

Now is a great opportunity to say, 
>“And if you missed it. I started a Patreon for my music. A portion of what I'm given goes to my favorite charity. <u>Join Me</u>!”

If someone clicks on your Patreon link and not the podcast, I'd consider that a success. Turning folks into patrons is the ultmate goal.
