your band needs three things online to even be apart of the game.

for people to “get you” you need:
- a sound
- an image
- a place

# a sound
people gotta know what you sound like. can totally be a demo. put your best stuff out there. 

# an image
people gotta know what you look like. the best is to have instruments or something in the image that makes it clear you‘re musicians.

# a place
people gotta be able to find you and contact you. ideally you have your own website, but a social media page that displays a myband@gmail.com email where people can contact you is great.


## the practicals
record and mix a demo. take a nice photo with your instrument. create a video with that photo as the background and your demo playing underneath it. post that on your preferred social media spot with the contact email easily found.

now you’re ready to send bookers to this page where they can decide whether your sound and look is what they’re into. 

it’s the bare minimum. it’s the first step.
